  <body>
Yesterday duing the 8th-grade lunch period, a fight broke out in the main hallway of McMath Middle School. The two men involved were Kelso and Kayden Curtis, and it is still unknown what started the altercation and how it was ended.
Principal Buddy Dunworth was the first to respond to the scene. He attempted to break up the fight, but was unsuccessful. Officer Scott, the school resource officer, then arrived and was able to separate the two men.
After the fight was over, Mr. Adams and Ms. Wagner, two of the school counselors, were called in to talk to the men involved. They spent time talking to Kelso and Kayden individually, trying to figure out what had happened and why.
The school administration is still investigating the incident, and no decisions have been made yet in regards to any disciplinary action. Principal Dunworth has released a statement, saying that the school is taking the incident very seriously and will be looking into it further.
This is not the first time that an altercation has occurred within the walls of McMath. The school is taking steps to ensure that such behavior does not happen again, and that students are aware of the consequences if it does. The administration is also reminding students and parents that bullying and physical violence are not tolerated on school grounds.
